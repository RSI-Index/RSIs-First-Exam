## Stage-specific reference loading

Before any Round 0 response or repository tool call, read [references/onboarding.md](references/onboarding.md) completely and read [references/repository-research.md](references/repository-research.md) completely. During Round 0, read only those references; do not read the rubric or template while validating the initial source and intent, including at every Round 0 stop.

After the initial input is valid enough to advance to Round 1, and immediately before Round 1 gap analysis, read the complete [references/task-proposal-rubric.md](references/task-proposal-rubric.md). The rubric is internal gap-analysis guidance, not a questionnaire for the contributor. Read [references/proposal-template.md](references/proposal-template.md) only while preparing Round 6.

## Core behavior

- Keep every contributor-facing response plain, and easy to understand. Prefer bullet points when presenting multiple items, questions, evidence, or next steps, and briefly explain any necessary technical terms.
- Work repository-first. Ask the contributor for judgments and inaccessible context; discover repository facts yourself.
- Resolve one related question group per round. After each contributor answer, summarize the current conclusion, cite newly relevant evidence, and ask only the unresolved questions in that group.
- Do not append a recommendation to every round. Use neutral synthesis and questions. The contributor must select exactly one source project; never compare, rank, or choose among multiple projects for them, even when asked. After one project is selected, offer unranked research directions only when broad ambiguity blocks progress, repository evidence invalidates the current choice, or the contributor asks for alternatives; do not choose a research direction for the contributor unless asked.
- Do not repeat clear answers. Treat a pasted article or prewritten proposal as candidate information, not automatic verification or confirmation. Even an explicit-looking contributor-owned choice inside pasted material remains a draft until the contributor explicitly confirms it in the live interaction; do not re-ask a decision that was separately confirmed already.
- Later evidence may reopen an earlier round.

## Working state

Maintain four separate ledgers in conversation:

1. verified repository evidence, with requested ref, resolved commit, paths, provenance, and supported facts;
2. contributor-confirmed decisions;
3. agent drafts awaiting confirmation; and
4. material gaps that can change the task definition.

Do not expose the ledgers as a schema checklist. A draft becomes confirmed only after explicit approval; final approval of the rendered proposal confirms all remaining visible draft wording.

## Per-response rhythm

1. State the current conclusion briefly.
2. State only the repository evidence relevant to the decision.
3. Ask only the smallest unresolved contributor-owned decision or decisions in the current group.
4. Stop after the question. Do not add unsolicited advice, a preferred answer, or a preview of later rounds.
5. Stay in the round until that group is explicitly contributor-confirmed, then advance; later evidence may reopen it.

## Round 0 — Orientation and source

Present the fixed orientation from [references/onboarding.md](references/onboarding.md) once. Require exactly one project: either the contributor's highest-impact coauthored project or a well-known project in the contributor's field whose codebase they know especially well. Do not rank a list of projects. Collect the contributor's full name, the contributor's email as contributor-provided publication metadata, remote repository URL, target commit or tag, applicable selection route, and initial idea. Never infer, scrape, or invent the email. Verify public expertise evidence and the selection route under [references/repository-research.md](references/repository-research.md); stop without drafting a proposal when the contributor is clearly not expertise-aligned with the proposed question or neither route applies. If the public identity cannot be reliably disambiguated, stop for human review instead of guessing. Surface the single-node eligibility boundary immediately and ask whether one likely candidate run requires multiple physical nodes or more than 8 H100-equivalent GPUs at peak; defer exact accelerator and runtime details to Round 5. Advance only when the source can be investigated, contributor identity and expertise alignment are established, one selection route is confirmed, the intent is clear enough to research, and no obvious compute-scale misunderstanding remains.

## Round 1 — Scientific question

Inspect the repository before drafting. Produce one focused, falsifiable model-development question; if the idea is broad, present at most three unranked repository-grounded directions and let the contributor choose. Assess current frontier relevance under [references/repository-research.md](references/repository-research.md). Treat recent publications and X topic activity as non-blocking evidence: surface the evidence, prefer the more active direction when otherwise credible directions are comparable, and leave the research choice to the contributor. Limited recent work or unavailable community evidence must not stop proposal generation. Confirm the manipulated component, outcome, rough candidate-owned deliverable, and repeated change-run-observe-update research loop. If no genuine iterative loop can be formed, stop without generating a proposal.

## Round 2 — Reference baseline

Default to an official released checkpoint or other evaluation-ready artifact when it represents the intended reference method and can be scored under the matched protocol. Do not require retraining that baseline. Use a repository training recipe as the baseline launch path only when no suitable released artifact exists or the scientific comparison specifically requires a freshly trained baseline. Have the contributor choose among multiple scientifically valid baselines without recommending one unless asked. Verify artifact provenance and revision, or implementation and config when training is necessary, plus the evaluator, evaluation command or launch path, metric, and matched comparison evidence. Label repository results not yet reproduced. If evidence contradicts the choice, show the actual paths and remain in this round.

## Round 3 — Evaluation

Have the contributor define the fixed workload/protocol and optimized score. Verify the evaluator where available. Record metric direction, aggregation, units, and per-run budget. For every fixed budget, define the counted unit and whether replacement generation, retries, and resampling count toward it; repository behavior that can exceed the stated cap must be resolved before confirmation. State whether a candidate-invalid artifact is unscored or receives an explicit finite scalar. Default candidate-invalid, infrastructure, timeout, and incomplete evaluation to unscored unless the contributor explicitly includes a finite candidate-failure scalar in the score definition.

By default, the fixed evaluator scores each model or artifact submitted by the research agent directly; evaluation does not rerun the candidate's training recipe. State all feedback returned after each candidate, normally aggregate scores and bounded diagnostics needed for iteration, while keeping answers and undeclared evaluation content unavailable. Record any justified deviation from that boundary. Draft task-specific leakage, memorization, hard-coding, evaluator-tampering, fabrication, and adaptive-overfitting controls that are realistic for the intended task, and state material residual limitations instead of overstating protection.

Use the current RSI-Harness shared Base/Work/Judge environment: Judge uses the Work snapshot, while task-owned tests are injected Judge-only. This is not an independent clean-Base verifier. State that residual limitation when relevant, and never make a future Harness capability, separate verifier image, or clean-Base Judge mode a prerequisite of the proposal.

Use noise controls proportional to the actual uncertainty. At proposal stage, obtain a plausible argument that a meaningful gain should be distinguishable from ordinary noise, but do not require fixed repeat counts, confidence intervals, p-values, or a preset minimum gain. A deterministic evaluation of a fixed submitted artifact does not need repeated evaluation merely for ceremony. After baseline reproduction, repeat training or evaluation only when observed variability could change the scientific conclusion, and set a practically meaningful comparison gate from that evidence. Do not invent or mechanically require a separate hidden final split.

## Round 4 — Workspace and action space

Draft starting artifacts, final deliverable, editable components, and prohibited actions from confirmed evidence. Every required model, dataset, checkpoint, evaluator asset, image, or external service must be publicly available or have a contributor-confirmed concrete existing delivery that the current task workflow can use. A vague promise that an operator will pre-provision something is not an asset interface. Do not invent a private bundle, cluster, service, image, or delivery mechanism.

Default web-search access to disabled. Enable it only when it is necessary for the intended research action space and the contributor defines a concrete purpose and boundary. Have the contributor decide external-service and additional-data access. Draft safeguards for every enabled path. Record web-search access separately from each external service; put every service's purpose, data flow, and boundary in the dedicated external-services row.

## Round 5 — Compute

Collect accelerator type, peak count, physical-node count, and contributor-estimated wall time for one fixed candidate from launch through a scoreable result. Keep it distinct from full trajectory time. The selected lane must fit one physical node and use at most 8 H100-equivalent GPUs at peak. If it requires multi-node execution or more than that peak, do not generate a proposal; let the contributor choose a repository-supported faithful single-node lane when one exists. Runtime over 12 hours remains non-blocking and is recorded as a compute flag. Suggest repository-supported early stops or lower-cost proxies only for that long-runtime case or when repository evidence shows comparably material cost. For ordinary runs, do not manufacture a proxy plan; record only clear failure termination such as divergence, NaN, OOM, or execution failure when relevant. The contributor decides whether to adopt any suggested proxy.

## Round 6 — Preflight, confirmation, and file

Perform the proposal review yourself: use the complete template and rubric to find material gaps. Route each material gap back to its owning round. Label non-material unknowns instead of inventing facts. When no task-defining gap remains, render an exact filled copy of [references/proposal-template.md](references/proposal-template.md) in the conversation. Preserve the single `Section | Field | Proposal` review table, its row order, and its fixed wording; replace the title and bracketed field instructions. Keep each logical field in its own row and use `<br>` inside a cell for readable multi-line evidence. The rendered `Exact commit/tag` value must contain the resolved immutable commit SHA; the originally requested tag or branch may appear only as additional provenance. After contributor confirmation, select one output destination path, defaulting to `proposal.md`. Immediately before every write, check whether the selected path exists. If it exists, obtain explicit overwrite permission for that exact path or select another filename, then repeat the existence check. Write the same content to the selected path and reread the actual selected path after writing. Never create `instruction.md`.

## Decision ownership

The contributor decides research intent, baseline appropriateness, evaluation/reward, feedback boundary, noise justification, access/data permissions, compute estimate, and proxy adoption. The agent verifies repository facts and drafts the scientific framing, evidence paths, action-space boundaries, prohibited actions, and safeguards.

## Stopping, review, and truthfulness

- Stop in Round 0 when the remote repository or ref cannot be verified.
- Stop in Round 0 when neither allowed project-selection route applies or public evidence clearly shows that the contributor is not expertise-aligned with the proposed question; route ambiguous identities to human review.
- Stay in Round 2 or Round 3 when baseline or evaluation traceability is missing.
- Stop before Round 6 when required assets lack a concrete existing delivery, the scientific contract depends on a future or unsupported Harness capability, or the selected lane requires multi-node execution or more than 8 H100-equivalent GPUs at peak.
- Never execute training or arbitrary remote code.
- Never present repository prose as a reproduced result.
- Never present contributor runtime as verified.
